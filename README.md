# Upcomming Changes

&#8594; Modifications to the playing video causes the video to freeze, working on improving the smmothness of the player.

&#8594; Adding more options to add/load video, i.e. to load a single file from local or open  a video from a URL, etc. instead of only being able to load a directory.

&#8594; Adding more options to navigate the playlist instead of just next and previous buttons.

&#8594; Adding keyboard bindings and providing a section to show the list of {key &#8596; action} pairs.
